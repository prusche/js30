    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
    let age = 100;
    let age2 = age;
    // then
    let age = 200;
    //now, age = 200, but age2 still = 100; with arrays it is different
    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];
    const team = players;
    team[3] = "Lux";
    //this changes the original array players because team was only a reference to it

    //instead, we make a copy, this way:
    const team2 = players.slice();
    //another way to copy the array is:
    const team3 = [].concat(players);
    //or we can use teh ES6 spread way:
    const team4 = [...players];
    //or we do this:
    const team5 = Array.from(players);

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object
    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };
    // and think we make a copy: const captain = person --no, makes a reference

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const captain2 = Object.assign({}, person, {age: 99, height: '6.0'});
    //the above creates an empty object {}, grabs the one we are copying, and
    //then changes whatever value we want

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread -- not available yet?
    const captain3 = {...person}
    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects.
    const wes = {
      name: 'wes',
      age = 100,
      social: {
        twitter: '@wesbos',
        facebook: 'wesbos.developer'
      }
    };
    //can't handle arrays or objects within arrays/objects, can use the function clonedeep, but don't
    // so on the above we try const dev = Object.assign({}, wes)
    // then we change dev: dev.social.twitter = '@coolman', will also change wes
    // there is a function called cloneDeep but not a good idea in general

    // lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
    //one way, though he doesn't recommend it:
    const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(wes));
    //it converts the entire object to a string, then immediately parses it back into an object
    //then you can do dev2.social.twitter = '@coolman' and it won't change wes
